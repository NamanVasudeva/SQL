# SQL
Practice of sql learned at FORE School on different datasets

Film Locations is a dataset containing details about movies, the directors, location, writer author etc. On this dataset I have practices retreiving different tables using various conditions. The main conditions practiced were where, count, distinct, limit and offset. I also learnt how to handel column names containing spaces in SQL by using reverse tick.
