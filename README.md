# SQL
Practice of sql learned at FORE School on different IBM course datasets

**Film Locations** is a dataset containing details about movies, the directors, location, writer author etc. On this dataset I have practices retreiving different tables using various conditions. The main conditions practiced were where, count, distinct, limit and offset. I also learnt how to handel column names containing spaces in SQL by using reverse tick.

**HR Database** is a databse containing different tables regarding the employees, their job history, their jobs, departments and locations. There were different problems for calling that data with conditons that were practiced. Like if the exact year or loaction is not used '%' operator is used and the use of group by sort and other conditional statements. Also, count, nested selection, and joins were practice on this database.

**Pet Rescue Database** is a database containg details of rescue of different types of pets, the cost, quantity and date rescued. Practiced using date, where, round, average and ucase.
